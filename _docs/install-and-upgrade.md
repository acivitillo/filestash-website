## Requirement

The official installation guide requires a Linux server with the following tools installed:
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/){:rel="nofollow"}
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/){:rel="nofollow"}
- curl (very likely already installed in your linux distribution)

Hardware requirement is minimal: 64MB of RAM and 1 core will give you plenty of comfort. If you're expecting heavier load, we have some numbers [here](/2019/05/06/benchmark/)

## Installation
The installation can be done in 3 bash commands:
<div class="terminal">
<span class="prompt">~/$ </span>mkdir filestash && cd filestash<br>
<span class="prompt">~/filestash$ </span>curl -O https://downloads.filestash.app/latest/docker-compose.yml<br>
<span class="stdout">
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current<br>
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed<br>
100   322  100   322    0     0     98      0  0:00:03  0:00:03 --:--:--    98<br>
</span>
<span class="prompt">~/filestash$ </span>docker-compose up -d<br>
<span class="stdout">
Creating filestash_app ... <br>
Creating filestash_app ... done
</span>
</div>

*Note*: Official Docker images are made available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/machines/filestash/).

Once the installation has complete, open up a browser and navigate to: `http://your_ip:8334`, you will be greet with the setup screen:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash_images/master/screenshots/setup.png" alt="setup screenshot" height="320px"/>
Enter the admin password you want to use to protect the admin console. The admin console is available at the `/admin` url.

Once done, you will reach the last step of the configuration which look like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash_images/master/screenshots/setup_stage2.png" alt="stage 2 of the setup- screenshot" height="320px"/>
If you're not too sure about linux servers and selfhosting, you will want to select `yes`. This will expose your instance to the internet via a filestash URL like https://user-foo.filestash.app.

Otherwise, just skip this screen and get yourself set like you'd do for any other selfhosted app. Also if you want to dig onto what this is about, read [this](#note-on-the-proxy-feature)

Once this is done, you should be ready to go

## Preparing your instance

1. For a production instance, it is advised to fill the `host` value under `configure->general` with your domain name. This enable some additional security measures like HSTS and host name verification

2. You can enable the full text search via the admin console. This feature is disabled by default for 2 reasons:
    - associated cost when you use a vendor like [S3]({% post_url 2019-11-21-s3-browser %}) that charges both for the bandwith and API calls. In your settings you can change the reindex time to a higher value to minimise cost at the expense of having some stale data in your index.
    - a privacy concern as creating a searchable index will result in your instance crawling through your content and persist some data locally for the purpose of answering those search queries

## Upgrade

Upgrades are straightforward:

<div class="terminal">
<span class="prompt">~/filestash$ </span>curl -O https://downloads.filestash.app/latest/docker-compose.yml<br>
<span class="stdout">
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current<br>
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed<br>
100   322  100   322    0     0     98      0  0:00:03  0:00:03 --:--:--    98<br>
</span>
<span class="prompt">~/filestash$ </span>docker-compose pull<br>
<span class="stdout">

<span class="prompt">~/filestash$ </span>docker-compose up -d<br>
<span class="stdout">

Recreating filestash_app ... done
</span>
</div>

## Alternative installation methods

*Warning*: to date, docker is the only officially supported installation method that's available free of charge. The reason is creating and maintaining hundreds of guides for every possible linux distribution isn't trivial with linux packaging alone beeing a massive rabbit hole that can only be illustrated by [this XKCD](https://xkcd.com/927/){:rel="nofollow"}. If you need to have Filestash working in a production setting without docker, contact us and we'll make it work as part of a support contract

In the meantime, community supported guides are also available:
- SRugina: [ubuntu instructions + script](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash/pull/136)
- ACivitillo: [Installing Filestash with the Nomad Orchestrator](http://assyem.com/installing-filestash-with-nomad.html)

If you want to install Filestash on your own with a more custom build approach, the reference is the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash/blob/master/docker/prod/Dockerfile){:rel="nofollow"}. This recipe is just 1 example of a custom compilation that emphasis on speed, efficiency and features at the cost of installation size. You could shrink down the required space by 90% by disabling features such as image transcoding (getting rid of libvips and libraw), org-mode export (getting rid of emacs and our latex distribution) and other tools (such as pdftotext, ...)

## Optional: Using a reverse proxy

Using a reverse proxy isn't mandatory but is quite usefull when you have multiple things installed on your server and can't dedicate the port 80 and 443 to 1 application.

A sample configuration for nginx:
```
# change the env variable to what you want to use
export FILESTASH_DOMAIN=demo.filestash.app
openssl dhparam -out /etc/letsencrypt/live/$FILESTASH_DOMAIN/dh2048.pem -outform PEM -2 2048

cat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/filestash.conf <<EOF
server {
    listen         80;
    server_name    $FILESTASH_DOMAIN;
    return         301 https://\$server_name\$request_uri;
}
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name $FILESTASH_DOMAIN;
    expires \$expires;

    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/$FILESTASH_DOMAIN/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/$FILESTASH_DOMAIN/privkey.pem;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/live/$FILESTASH_DOMAIN/dh2048.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:!DSS';
    ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;

    location / {
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade \$http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        proxy_set_header     Host \$host:\$server_port;
        proxy_set_header     X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header     X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header     X-Forwarded-Proto \$scheme;
        proxy_set_header     Origin '';

        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

        proxy_pass           http://127.0.0.1:8334;
        proxy_read_timeout   86400;
    }
}
EOF

ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/filestash.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/filestash.conf
nginx -t && service nginx restart
```

**Note**: Resist the temptation of using gzip and other caching mechanism at the reverse proxy level, you would waste valuable CPU cycles adding latency and increasing the bandwith usage, creating issues with cache invalidation. Filestash is already doing its best at compile time optimising at a level no reverse proxy could ever do with a few lines of configuration and no deep knowledge of the underlying service.

## Optional: Using a bind mount to persist configuration

You can persist the configuration of your instance by using bind mounts in the `docker-compose.yml`.
This might  be useful, if you use tools like watchtower to automatically upgrade deployed containers.

In most use-cases only the `/app/data/state`-folder should be persisted, as it contains the configuration files and database.

Filestash currently *does not* create the needed files in an empty mount. Instead, you need to copy the base configuration after the first start.

1. Create the directory, which shall be used for the mount
1. Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to start the container (*do not* add the `volumes`-tag yet): `docker-compose up -d`
1. Copy the contents of the `/app/data/state/`-folder from within the running container to your host directory by issuing the following command on the host: `docker cp filestash:/app/data/state /path/to/your/local/mount/directory` (The name of the container may vary depending on your configuration)
1. Stop the container: `docker-compose down`
1. Add the following block to you `docker-compose.yml` (at the same indent level as `image`):
```
...
volumes:
      - path/to/your/local/mount/directory:/app/data/state
...
```
At the next start, the container will use the files saved on the host and your configuration will be kept throughout restarts and upgrades.

Keep in mind that updates may change the structure of the directory and therefore may require to modify the contents of the mount by hand, although the goal is to automatically migrate via scripts in this case.

## Note on the proxy feature

**How does this work?** the proxy work by establishing a bidirectional tunnel between your server and our public proxy server. Incoming traffic to the filestash domain will then use that tunnel.

**Why should I care?** The motivation behind this feature is security as we discovered (big thank you to the people would have opt in the telemetry) many people didn't bothered to properly secured their instance and domain

**Pro and Cons:** This approach isn't perfect, it adds on latency and won't give control of the proxy server. However, it has benefits such as:
- it is secure by default
- you aren't require to be an admin of anything to make it work
- if a security vulnerability comes up, we will be able to block potential exploit

**Your domain name**: If you have the tunnel enable, a filestash sub domain will be automatically assigned to your instance (eg: user-foo.filestash.app). We can change this domain to whatever you want (eg: stallman.filestash.app) but considering the extra cost associated with that feature (our server aren't free) we will only do it for the people supporting the project.
